            <h2 class="small-caps">Introduction</h2>
                    <p>UX is a traditionally Western field. As it becomes more popular and practiced internationally, many researchers have questioned whether UX research methods are as effective in non-Western cultures. Existing research suggests that culture does have an impact on UX research methods. However, many of these studies compare methods across broad, international groups. As a result, their findings are limited to the hegemonic cultural groups of each country. Additionally, while there are studies that compare UX research methods across cultural groups within an individual country, these studies do not occur in the West. In general, there is an assumption that traditional UX research methods are effective across all of the West when there is a lack of research supporting this.</p>
                    <p>To begin to address this gap, I tested three UX research methods with Black, Asian, and Latinx women. First, participants were asked to think aloud, complete a survey, and participate in an interview as part of a typical usability study. Then, in a follow-up interview, we discussed their experiences with each of the three methods. These discussions, combined with my observations, <span class="highlight">suggest that Black, Asian, and Latinx women experience UX research methods differently.</span></p>

            <h2 class="small-caps">Literature Review</h2>
            <h3>What do we know about culture and UX research methods?</h3>
                    <p>To give a quick recap of existing research, I've identified <span class="highlight">two types of studies</span> that deal with culture and UX research methods. The first type of study is what I call the “international study.” <span class="highlight">International studies test and compare UX research methods across multiple countries.</span> For example, a 2002 study by Evers tested the think aloud, survey, and interview with English, North American, Dutch, and Japanese participants.</p>
                    <!--<img src="/assets/p1-lit-review-map-1.png" alt="map of international studies">-->
                    <p>The second type of study is what I call the “national study.” These studies are similar in that they test UX research methods across cultural groups. However, <span class="highlight">national studies differ because they focus on cultural groups within one country.</span> A 2011 study by Hsieh, for example, tested UX research methods with younger and older Taiwanese participants. There have been similar studies in Malaysia, India, and Namibia that compare age, gender, and class groups.</p>
                    <!--<img src="/assets/p1-lit-review-map-2.png" alt="map of national studies">-->
                    <p>Both national and international studies have found that <span class="highlight">culture does have an impact</span> on the efficacy of UX research methods. Evers found that surveys posed problems for English, Dutch, and Japanese participants. Hsieh found that younger Taiwanese participants were more likely to give feedback and criticism than older Taiwanese participants.</p>
            <h3>Discussion</h3>
                    <p>With that being said, there are some issues to consider with the research so far.</p>
                    <p>First, <span class="highlight">international studies lack specificity.</span> Because they are comparing such broad groups, it's important to question who exactly is being represented. <span class="highlight">Who were the “North American” participants in Evers' study?</span> What does all of North America have in common that the entire continent was being compared to individual countries? As a Black and Mexican-American person, these were my first questions. Later, I realized that Evers was referring to US Americans. Although I was initially mistaken, there was still a question of representation. And, while I first asked this question of Evers' study, it is a valid question for any of the international studies. <span class="highlight">How well were marginalized groups represented in these studies?</span></p>
                    <p>As for the national studies, they don't have this problem because of their narrow scope. However, it is worth noting that <span class="highlight">none of these studies occur in the West.</span> That means</p>

In general, all of the methods were described as easy, with the interview being ranked the most favorite across all women. The think aloud was ranked second. Although it was unfamiliar, many women enjoyed the freedom of saying all of their thoughts uninterrupted. The survey ranked last, mainly out of indifference. It was described as straightforward, but limited and forgettable.</p> 
                <p>Still, Black and Latinx women did experience some tension during the think aloud. This suggests that <span class="highlight">Black and Latinx women may hesitate to fully participate</span> in the UX research process.</p>

            <h4>Land Acknowledgment</h4>
                <p>We recognize that California State University, San Bernardino sits on the territory and ancestral land of the San Manuel Band of Mission Indians (Yuhaaviatam). We recognize that every member of the California State University, San Bernardino community has benefitted and continues to benefit from the use and occupation of this land since the institution's founding in 1965.</p>
                <p>Consistent with our values of community and diversity, we have a responsibility to acknowledge and make visible the university's relationship to Native peoples. By offering this Land Acknowledgment, we affirm Indigenous sovereignty and will work to hold California State University, San Bernardino more accountable to the needs of American Indian and Indigenous peoples.</p>
