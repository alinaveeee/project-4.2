            <h1 class="first-item">About Me</h1>
            <p>Alina Verduzco is a fourth-year undergraduate student pursuing a  bachelor's degree in graphic design.</p> 

            <p>She began her studies at California State University, San Bernardino in the fall of 2019. She was automatically admitted to the University Honors Program, where was encouraged to continue her community involvement and pursue her research interests.</p> 
                
            <p>In her second year, she attended a symposium on UX/UI design. Inspired by human centered design practices and eager to learn more, Alina took it upon herself to research the practice on her own time. Along with her independent research, Alina sought out mentorship from Prof. Rob Ray.</p> 
                
            <p>In her senior research project, Alina is investigating the impact of culture on traditional UX research methods with Black, Asian, and Latinx women. She was driven to do this research after seeing most studies focus on international cultural groups. Growing up in a diverse community and being mixed-race herself, Alina wondered how well marginalized communities were being represented in these studies. She questioned the assumption that UX methods work for everyone in the West when there was no research centering specifically on the experiences of marginalized Westerners. She hopes that her project can begin to address this gap in research.</p> 
                
            <p>Alina has volunteered as an English Conversation Partner since the fall of 2021, where she enjoys working with small groups of English learning Korean high school students in casual conversation sessions. Today, she sees the connection between her volunteer work and her passion for UX research methods, particularly user interviews.</p>
                
            <p>Alina currently works as a graphic designer for Associated Students, Incorporated, where she creates marketing and promotional materials for events and services on campus.</p> 
                
            <p>Alina has made the Dean's List every semester and holds a 4.0 GPA. She is expected to graduate in May 2023 summa cum laude with Art & Design Honors. She plans to work in UX/UI design and research. A lifelong learner, Alina also has plans to return to school for a master's in human centered design.</p>
